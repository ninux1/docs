Three-tier DCN Topology :
* composed of three layers of network switches, namely access, aggregate, and core layers.
* The aggregate layer switches interconnects multiple access layer switches together.
* Core layer switches interconnects multiple aggregate level switches.
* Core layer switches are also responsible for connecting the data center to the Internet.

Major problems faced by the three-tier architecture:
* scalability, fault tolerance, energy efficiency, and cross-sectional bandwidth.
