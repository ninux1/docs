Three-tier DCN Topology :
* composed of three layers of network switches, namely access, aggregate, and core layers.
* The aggregate layer switches interconnects multiple access layer switches together.
* Core layer switches interconnects multiple aggregate level switches.
* Core layer switches are also responsible for connecting the data center to the Internet.

Major problems faced by the three-tier architecture:
* scalability, fault tolerance, energy efficiency, and cross-sectional bandwidth.
* The three-tier architecture uses enterprise-level network devices at the higher layers of topology that are very expensive and power hungry

Oversubscription, in a SAN (storage area network) switching environment, is the practice of connecting multiple devices to the same switch port to optimize switch use.
