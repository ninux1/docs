* Get Involved in OPNFV
* Testing or Development either works fine
* check the projects you wish to contribute to.
* One of the important factors in NFV while saving the capital expense is to make sure that if the NFVi is able to provide expected performance out of software network functions which replaces hardware network functions, else the whole concept of NFVi is eroded.
* Which means basically we should close the price performance gap between NFVi and hardware network functions.  
* Also there should be some way to check the VNf's launched on NFVi are genuine. Intel trusted execution can be utilized here.
* Key NFV requirements are security , interoperability, performance etc.
