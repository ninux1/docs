* Get Involved in OPNFV
* Testing or Development either works fine
* check the projects you wish to contribute to.
* One of the important factors in NFV while saving the capital expense is to make sure that if the NFVi is able to provide expected performance out of software network functions which replaces hardware network functions, else the whole concept of NFVi is eroded.
* Which means basically we should close the price performance gap between NFVi and hardware network functions.  
* Also there should be some way to check the VNf's launched on NFVi are genuine. Intel trusted execution can be utilized here.
* Key NFV requirements are security , interoperability, performance etc.
* NFV layers can be visualized as NFVi, VNF's and MANO
* Old Paradigm is Pets infrastructure where each component needs to be cared for, for availability , failure etc. 
* New Paradigm is cattle infrastructure where there are multiple instances which come and go and there is a constant availability of the service. This is instance based like vcpus and vistualized hardware etc.
* Cloud native apps scale by increasing the number of instances rather than adding more resources to a given instance.
* Antifragility  --> Netflix has pioneered a new field of “chaos engineering” where they fail instances, networks, availability zones and entire regions to test to ensure antifragility. In production. All the time.
